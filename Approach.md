# Approach solving the challenge

## 1. TEST DATA GENERATION

Hubspot needs test data, only companies and contacts are taken into account.

A test data generator is written separately in order to generate mock data that can be imported into Hubspot, XLSX format. 10000 company records and 10000 contact records.

Issue `npm run gen` for generating Companies.xlsx and Contacts.xlsx

The 2 files can be imported into Hubspot as single object imports.
